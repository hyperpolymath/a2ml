= A2ML (Attested Markup Language)
:toc: preamble
:toclevels: 2

A2ML is a lightweight, Djot-like markup that compiles into a typed, attested core.
It keeps authoring simple while allowing strong structural guarantees when you
want them.

This repository is a satellite of the Hyperpolymath standards hub.

== Why A2ML

* Lightweight authoring with progressive strictness (lax -> checked -> attested)
* Strong guarantees: required sections, resolved references, unique IDs
* Opaque payloads preserved byte-for-byte for absolute fidelity
* Renderer portability across HTML/Markdown/PDF pipelines

== Quick Start (Module 0)
